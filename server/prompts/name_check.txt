I'm going to give you a proposed pseudonym for a user in a reddit-like online forum that aspires to higher levels of civility. 
I want you to tell me if the username is likely to cause problems in the forum. 

Reasons to reject a pseudonym include:
* Swear words
* References to sex, drugs, illegal activity
* Derogatory terms for groups
* Any other reason this username would be likely to cause issues

I want you to respond with a JSON object of the following form:
{"violates": [true or false]}

The pseudonym is in {{language}} and is: "{{name}}"
