I'm going to give you a pseudonym that someone asked to use in an internet forum.

I want you to tell me whether this pseudonym looks like the name of a real person
with first and last name.

For example "joeblogs" looks like a real name, but "amazingcarrot" doesn't 
and "joe" doesn't (because it lacks a last name).


I want you to reply with a JSON object of the following form: 

{"resembles_full_name": [true or false]}

The pseudonym is in {{language}} and is "{{name}}"
